The Student Attendance Management System We developed using C++ is a dynamic program aimed at efficiently tracking student attendance.
It allows for seamless management of attendance records by providing a user-friendly interface for teachers or administrators to input and update attendance data.
Additionally, the system integrates with Excel sheets, enabling easy exporting and manipulation of attendance data for further analysis or reporting purposes.
With its dynamic programming approach, the system ensures flexibility and scalability to meet the evolving needs of educational institutions in managing student attendance effectively.
This program is done by 23aiml052,23aiml059 and 23aiml072. 
you can see in history which part of the code is done by us.
thank you :)
